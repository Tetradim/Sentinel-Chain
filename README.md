# Auto-Crypto

Auto-Crypto is a paper-first crypto trading automation service for Discord and webhook-driven alerts. The first implementation slice focuses on safe signal intake, risk checks, idempotency, and paper execution with bracket-style exits.

## Current Capabilities

- TradingView/custom webhook endpoint: `POST /webhooks/tradingview`
- Text alert webhook endpoint: `POST /webhooks/text-alert`
- Strict crypto signal normalization for pairs such as `BTCUSDT` and `BTC/USDT`
- Duplicate signal suppression with idempotency keys, including SQLite-backed restart safety
- Pre-trade risk checks for stop-loss requirement, max order notional, max open notional, leverage, slippage, allowed venues, blocked symbols, and daily loss
- Paper exchange that records accepted orders, planned stop-loss/take-profit exits, and triggered paper exits per filled lot
- Minimal Discord slash-command client using `/health` and `/signal_test`
- Optional CCXT adapter boundary for future live exchange integrations
- Exchange discovery and capability reporting for paper mode and installed CCXT venues
- Optional HMAC-signed webhook verification through `AUTO_CRYPTO_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- SQLite repository for signal, paper-order, and audit history
- Operator halt/resume controls that block new orders and record audit events
- Paper portfolio accounting with weighted average entry and realized PnL, rehydrated from SQLite order history on restart
- Paper market price updates that trigger stop-loss/take-profit exits and audit events
- Approval-required mode for human review before order execution, with SQLite-backed pending approvals
- Conservative text alert parser for Discord-style messages

Live trading is intentionally not enabled by default. Do not grant withdrawal permissions to exchange API keys.

## Quick Start

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest
python -m uvicorn autocrypto.app:app --reload
```

For environment-backed settings, import and run `autocrypto.app:create_app_from_env()` from your ASGI launcher. `AUTO_CRYPTO_DB_PATH` enables SQLite persistence, and `AUTO_CRYPTO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` enables signed webhook enforcement.
`AUTO_CRYPTO_ALLOWED_EXCHANGES` defaults to `paper`; add venue IDs such as `binance` or `kraken` only after API keys and live execution controls are ready.
Set `AUTO_CRYPTO_MAX_OPEN_NOTIONAL` above `0` to cap cumulative open buy exposure across accepted orders.
SQLite-backed paper state restores open exposure after restart, and triggered paper exits release exposure for later risk checks.

Install the optional exchange extras to inspect CCXT-supported venues:

```powershell
python -m pip install -e ".[exchange]"
```

Send a test signal:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri http://127.0.0.1:8000/webhooks/tradingview -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{
  "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
  "side": "buy",
  "quote_amount": "25",
  "price": "50000",
  "stop_loss_pct": "2",
  "take_profit_pct": "3"
}'
```

## Signed Webhooks

Set `AUTO_CRYPTO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to require signed webhook alerts. Signed requests must include:

- `x-auto-crypto-timestamp`: timestamp string chosen by the sender
- `x-auto-crypto-signature`: `sha256=<hex digest>`

The digest is `HMAC_SHA256(secret, timestamp + "." + raw_request_body)`.

When a signed request is accepted, the same timestamp/body pair is rejected on repeat as a replay. Apps that pass a webhook tolerance reject stale timestamps.

## History Endpoints

- `GET /signals`: accepted normalized signals
- `GET /orders`: accepted paper orders
- `GET /positions`: current paper portfolio positions
- `GET /audit`: signal and order lifecycle audit events

When `AUTO_CRYPTO_DB_PATH` is enabled, signal IDs are claimed with an insert-only write before approval or execution. Replayed signal IDs after a service restart return `status=duplicate` and record a `signal.duplicate` audit event.
Paper orders persisted in SQLite are replayed at startup to restore paper positions and active bracket lots.

## Exchange Discovery

- `GET /exchanges`: returns paper mode plus installed CCXT exchange IDs with separate `driver_available`, `credentials_configured`, and `live_execution_enabled` flags
- `GET /exchanges/paper/capabilities`: returns paper execution capabilities
- `GET /exchanges/{exchange_id}/capabilities`: returns CCXT-reported venue capabilities when `auto-crypto[exchange]` is installed

Exchange discovery does not enable live trading by itself. CCXT rows mean the adapter driver can be inspected, not that credentials are configured or live order placement is enabled.
Signals whose `exchange` value is not in `AUTO_CRYPTO_ALLOWED_EXCHANGES` are rejected by risk checks.

## Paper Price Updates

Use `POST /market/price` to feed paper-mode market prices into the bracket engine. When the new price crosses an active stop loss or take profit, Auto-Crypto records a synthetic sell order, closes the paper position, updates realized PnL, and records an `exit.triggered` audit event.
Multiple entries on the same symbol keep independent paper lots, so one take-profit or stop-loss trigger closes only the matching lot instead of flattening the whole symbol.

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri http://127.0.0.1:8000/market/price -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{
  "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
  "price": "51500"
}'
```

## Operator Controls

- `GET /control/status`: halt status
- `POST /control/halt` with `{"reason": "..."}`: blocks new order execution
- `POST /control/resume`: resumes new order execution

## Approval Mode

Set `AUTO_CRYPTO_REQUIRE_APPROVAL=true` or call `create_app(require_approval=True)` to queue incoming signals instead of executing immediately.
When `AUTO_CRYPTO_DB_PATH` is enabled, pending approvals survive service restarts and can be approved or rejected by any later app instance using the same database.

- `GET /approvals`: pending signals
- `POST /approvals/{signal_id}/approve`: executes the queued signal through the normal risk and execution path
- `POST /approvals/{signal_id}/reject` with `{"reason": "..."}`: removes the queued signal and records an audit event

## Signal Schema

Required:

- `symbol` or `ticker`
- `side` or `action`
- `quote_amount`, `notional`, `base_amount`, `quantity`, or `qty`

Recommended:

- `price`
- `stop_loss_pct`
- `take_profit_pct`
- `max_slippage_bps`
- `strategy_id`
- `exchange`

Forbidden signal actions include withdrawal and transfer actions.
The default allowed exchange is `paper`; alert-supplied live venue IDs must be configured before risk approval.

## Text Alert Format

The text parser is intentionally strict. Supported examples:

```text
BUY BTCUSDT $125 @ 50000 SL 2.5% TP 5%
SELL ETH/USDT 0.25 @ 3000
```

Use `POST /signals/parse-text` with `{"message": "..."}` to validate a message without placing an order.
Use `POST /webhooks/text-alert` with the same payload shape to run the parsed alert through duplicate checks, risk, approval mode, and paper execution.

## Roadmap

1. Wire Discord buttons to approval/halt endpoints.
2. Add official sandbox/live adapters behind explicit config gates.
3. Add portfolio reconciliation and exchange user-stream workers.
4. Add PostgreSQL deployment option for multi-user hosting.
5. Add deployment manifests and CI.
